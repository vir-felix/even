Hey {{user.name}},
<p>
    Somebody (hopefully you) has requested to change the password of your {{store.name}} account.
</p>
<p>
    <div class="btn btn-primary">
        <a href="{{passwordResetLink}}">{{"RESET PASSWORD"}}</a>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    In case you don't remember asking for this email, you can safely ignore and nothing will change.
